# java-tspvisualization

A small problem for my artificial intelligence class. This program will use and A* search in conjunction with an MST based heuristic
to solve the traveling salesperson problem optimally. The visualiztion shows each the evaluation of each frontier node. The user can adjust the number of points
in the problem and the time delay for the animation. And there's a reset button. 

This is setup as an eclipse project. 

I learned more about how to properly use threading in this application. I still have alot to learn but I can now have mutliple threads without 
some horrible error. Do to a functional style there was no worries this time using an ArrayList across two threads, but next time I will need to look
into a thread safe data structure.
